                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Salut!, bienvenue sur mon site, il s'appelle "AZ Times." (FN) <br>On my website, I tried to deliver some feature news that has attracted my interest. To do so, I worked on my site with constructed different documents and combined them
                        into appropriate places, with also the media information and more resources that necessary to convince the reader with sharing my opinions. In each of the articles, I would like to deliver "What has happened," "How is that affected
                        to us," evidence that support my statement, a resource to access the evidence, and possibly more multimedia that help the reader more understand the feature appearance.</p>

                    <h3>Inspirationn</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <Li>I decided to produce a newsletter website. I have started to design my website wireframes. For that, I visited some newsletter websites, such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.ntd.com/">NTD</a> and
                            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, to discover their web page layout. One of the element has inspired me is not too make the website too wordy. Appropriate use of images and compression of news content
                            into abstracts can help users choose their articles.</Li>
                        <Li>To further explorer the website design, I have reviewed our course's midterm project. Using the dynamic content section could save space for the reader to explorer the website. Therefore, I have tried two different ways to implement
                            the thought on the homepage (index.html) and the first article (news1.html).
                        </Li>
                        <Li>To discovering the website interface and the method to implement the design, I checked out the template provided from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">HTML5UP</a>. @ajlkn's template did inspire me to use the CSS file to design
                            the website.
                    </ul>

            <section>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <Li>Appropriate text size and boxing the content can help reader to read easily. </Li>
                        <Li>Incase of technique errors, for the attached images in the article, I have also labeled an alternative text, so that the reader won't feel hurt for their readability if the image has failed to load.</Li>
                        <Li>For all the international reader's needs, the google translator has embedded it at the footer that helps someone who likes to read the information in another language.</Li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3>Usability</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <Li>Readability, I believed which is the most concernedly of designing a newsletter website. Appropriate styles can help readers to read the articles more efficiently. </Li>
                        <Li>It is intelligent to provide accessible resources to the readers while we have used them in the articles. For the scenario in my first (news1.html), besides telling the readers what happened, I have also attached the downloadable
                            material for readers to read. </Li>
                        <Li>To keep the website loading quality, keep out of extreme size materials preloaded on the site. In my fourth article (news4.html), I have placed an external downloadable link and required action video on the site. Therefore, users
                            won't preload the material while browsing the site.</Li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Learning</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <Li>I created semi-synchronization functions in the home pages (index.html) that allow the contents unidirectional synchronized from the articles (news1-4.html). To approach it, I build a mimicry point-to-point system, using tag IDs
                            on the associate contents that to make a linking relationship, and used the script (index_getexternalobject.js) to implement the read and load functions to achieve my expeisolatelinetion.</Li>
                        <Li>I learned how to utilize the website using CSS while referencing different template examples. While I practiced it with five different website interfaces with a pair use of document object model and the CSS file.</li>
                        <li>To enhanced my learning of the CSS, I tried to design multiple animations using javascript paired with the CSS file. To achieve the goal, I have referenced different templates on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">HTML5UP</a>, with
                            different style. </li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
                    <p>I found the script (index_getexternalobject.js) on the home page (index.html), which let the articles' title, summary, icon, and published date will be synchronized with my other articles' articles' title, summary, an icon is pretty
                        cool and successful in my website project. As a web designer, besides the website interface, a consider on the editor side for letting the website be edit in more efficiently. For an example of what I am expecting, my home pages
                        that the place to appear the highlighted article will read the articles' title, the summary, the icon, and the published date from the article detail website (news1-4.html). In another word, for any information updated on my article
                        website, there will be brief information updated on my home page simultaneously.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
                    <p>Although the features on the homepages script are awesome, I believed I can achieve better automation in the articles. I should more discover the method of database used in the whole website, such as reading in .txt file for the article
                        content and images, so that the editor can create a thousand pages more based on the website structures. </p>
                    <p>Besides, improvement should be implemented on the attachment dimension. More skills are required in coding the CSS style for creating a more practical website for next time.</p>
