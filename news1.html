                <p>Severe special infectious pneumonia is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (abbreviation: SARS-CoV-2). The first known patient of the disease was diagnosed in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                    People's Republic of China at the end of 2019. After that, the disease broke out on a large scale and spread rapidly in various countries around the world, becoming one of the most fatal epidemics in human history. As of March 28,
                    2021, 192 countries and regions around the world have reported a total of more than 126 million confirmed cases and more than 2.777 million deaths. The spread is still ongoing. The estimated value of the fatality rate of this disease
                    varies greatly among countries in the world. As of February 8, 2021, the observed fatality rate of this disease in most countries is between 0.5% and 5.0%, and the global preliminary revised fatality rate is about 2.9%.</p>

                <h2 class="major">The epidemic has led to a decline in economic growth</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The company’s profits are declining, and it will reduce investment in fixed assets as a response strategy</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The income distribution situation worldwide will deteriorate. In fact, the epidemic has severely deteriorated the profitability of global companies. Similar to the global financial crisis in 2008, companies who want to restore
                            profits and profitability must bear the brunt of reductions in employees and salaries. This will make the already not optimistic income distribution even worse.</h4>

                        <h4>In other words, unit labor costs are under pressure to drop significantly, and household purchasing power will inevitably decrease accordingly. In addition, the asset price bubble triggered by the ultra-loose monetary policy will
                            further widen the gap between the working class and those who can invest in financial assets.</li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>The state’s involvement in the economy has led to an increase in the share of zombie companies. Interest rates have always been kept at a low level, and such enterprises that have no production results may continue to receive funds
                            from the government's preferential policies.</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Global financial turmoil may be one of the unintended consequences of the epidemic. The reason is that the capital flowing into emerging economies is volatile and the market has doubts about the role of the U.S. dollar as a reserve
                            currency.
                        </h4>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Unstable capital flow</h2>
                <p>The combination of extremely ample global liquidity and risk aversion sentiment may lead to highly unstable capital flows, which is critical for many emerging economies. The more emerging countries rely on external financing, the greater
                    the impact of this situation in terms of capital flow volatility and economic performance. Another source of financial turmoil is the world's growing doubts about the role of the US dollar, due to the lack of leadership in the US,
                    the sharp increase in US foreign debt, and the Federal Reserve's hyper-expansionary monetary policy. China is also very aware of the importance of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency for the long-term hegemony of the United States
                    and the United States weaponizing it to satisfy its own interests. This is obviously inconsistent with China's interests.</p>
                <h2>Education interruption</h2>
                <p>The last reason is the loss of human resources due to the interruption of global education and training. In view of the negative impact of the epidemic on household income in the next few years, the fertility rate is bound to decline for
                    many years to come. After a detailed analysis of the above reasons, it will be found that the ultra-low interest rate environment will continue, and the decline in economic growth in the medium term seems to be inevitable. The loss
                    of human resources, the loss of financial capital caused by the sudden drop in investment, and the destruction of business structures caused by corporate bankruptcy will all have a lasting impact, and demand policies will not be able
                    to change.</p>
                <h2>The need for social reform</h2>
                <p>Only innovation and changes in social norms can bring a buffer effect, including the rapid development of digitalization, further greening of economic activities, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to make efforts in technological and
                    social innovation to be able to offset the trend of lower potential growth rate. In general, the medium-term impact of the epidemic on the economy is not optimistic for companies, households, and the government. The impact on the world
                    economy is unprecedented, and not only due to immediate immediate impact. It is time to rethink the basic principles of our current economic model to mitigate these effects.</p>
