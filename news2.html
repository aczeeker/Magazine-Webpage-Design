                                    <p>The shipping company Evergreen Shipping received a notice from the owner of the chartered vessel Ever Given that the container vessel entered the Suez Canal from the north of the Red Sea at around 8 am Egypt time on
                                        March 23 (14:00 on the same day, Taipei time), and was at the southern end of the estuary. At 6 nautical miles, it was suspected of being hit by a strong wind instantly, causing the hull to deviate from the channel
                                        and accidentally bottomed and ran aground.</p>
                                    <p>Evergreen has urged the shipowner to report the cause of the accident, and worked out a plan with related units such as the Canal Administration to assist the ship in getting out of trouble as soon as possible. Ever
                                        Given is a 20,000 TEU-class container ship, which is chartered by Evergreen Shipping in the form of Time Charter. The crew is dispatched by the shipowner company. The ship is currently deployed on the Far East-Europe
                                        route.

                                        According to analysis by cargo operators, Evergreen may be fined due to the congestion of the canal. However, according to the current situation, the container ship has not sunk and is relatively easy to handle; as for the impact on freight rates and
                                        traffic, it depends on the time it takes for the container ship to solve the problem.

                                        About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The blockade of the canal results in approximately US$9.6 billion (Â£7 billion) in goods every day, or US$400 million per hour. At least, for the crude oil prices in the international market rose by 4% on March 24 due
                                        to concerns about the disruption of crude oil transportation.
